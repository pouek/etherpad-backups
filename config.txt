# Your sources are stored in an associative array.
# In shell we assign it with "array[key]=value"
# Each element in that array stores a name and a
# space-separated "server" + "pads" lists, hence the name "serpads".
# It must be called "serpads[server-name]" where server-name is a name
# you chose and that corresponds to the server, and will be the name 
# of the folder storing its pads in their own subfolders.
# The 1st strig must be the complete server address ending with /p/, and
# the other ones are the different pads you want to backup from that server.
# Examples : ['example_server']="https://example-server.org/p/ pad1 example2"
#  			 ['other-server']="https://other-server.org/p/ 1dap exampleZ"
